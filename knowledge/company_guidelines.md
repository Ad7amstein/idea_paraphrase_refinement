# Company Communication Guidelines

## Mission

We aim to promote respectful, inclusive, and constructive dialogue across all communications.

## Values

- Respect for diversity of thought and background.
- Clear, truthful, and non-manipulative messaging.
- Focus on clarity, empathy, and collaboration.

## Tone Guidelines

- Always use respectful and neutral language.
- Avoid sarcasm, slang, or language that may be perceived as aggressive or dismissive.
- Use positive framing: instead of "You failed to...", say "You can improve by..."

## Offensive Language Policy

- Avoid discriminatory, sexist, racist, or ableist language.
- Avoid swearing, harsh criticism, or hostile tone.
- Examples of red-flag phrases:
  - “That’s a stupid idea.”
  - “Only an idiot would do that.”
  - “You clearly have no clue.”

## Clarity and Readability

- Aim for short, active sentences.
- Avoid jargon unless necessary; explain terms clearly.
- Prefer specific words over vague ones.
  - ❌ Bad: "Make it better"
  - ✅ Good: "Improve sentence clarity and remove redundancies."

## Key Message Standards

- Messages must align with the company mission.
- Ideas should be actionable, ethical, and evidence-informed.
